My background in clinical medicine and patient care motivated me to pursue translational research that bridges clinical questions with mechanistic insights in immunology and metabolism. I lead two projects: one investigates Metforminâ€™s modulation of viral infections via metabolic and anti-inflammatory pathways, and the other examines dendritic cell Complex I dysfunction and its impact on antiviral immunity.
