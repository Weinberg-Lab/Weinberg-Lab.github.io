Yichen Gong is a Ph.D. student in the Weinberg lab through the DGP program. Her research focuses on using CRISPR screens to investigate dendritic cells within the tumor microenvironment. In addition to her Ph.D. work, she is also pursuing an MPH in public health. Outside the lab, Yichen loves exploring new attractions, playing video games, and spending time with cats and dogs (the fluffier, the better).
